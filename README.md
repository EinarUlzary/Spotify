Spotify songs analysis
In this project, I got dataset that contains more than 160.000 songs collected from Spotify Web API.
In the first section, I explored the database. First, I import the data from a CSV file to Python and I explored the data in statistical aspects using Pandas library which helped me find interesting information about the dataset. Then I proceeded to more advanced analysis and used more advanced functions to learn more meaningful information about my data, do advanced analytics, and present it with visualization so I could see the results more clearly and see the data behavior. In order to use the machine learning and deep learning algorithm, I performed pre-processing to convert the raw data to a sustainable format for analysis. Then, I perform a re-analysis of the data in order to draw new conclusions about the relevant information.
In the last section, I used the Dataset after pre-processing and built a ‘Kmeans’ model for the unsupervised learning algorithm and a Decision Tree model for the supervised learning algorithm. I used my previous knowledge to arrange the data to better fit the model.
